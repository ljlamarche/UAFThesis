% The following is a (hopefully) helpful, informative example thesis.tex file for the uafthesis.cls style file.
% 	If you are so inclined, feel free to use this example for your actual .tex file. If not, do your own 
%	thing. I won't be offended. 
%	I wrote my thesis (dissertation?) in the manuscript format (3 papers, general introduction and conclusion), 
%	but the following example should be germane to all formats.

% A note about building your thesis:
%	If you have some flavor of linux, I highly recommend using a shell script for the following. Otherwise, you'll
%	need to run each of these commands in turn:
%	
%	>pdflatex uaf_thesis_example.tex
%	>bibtex uaf_thesis_example
%	>bibtex introduction (and each chapter that has a bibliography, in order)
%	>pdflatex uaf_thesis_example.tex
%	>pdflatex uaf_thesis_example.tex (to get all references, citations, etc. in there)

\documentclass{uafthesis} %It will be double-sided, opening to the right, and 11pt font. If you don't want those options, use (for example) the following: \documentclass[12pt]{uafthesis}. You can also make a draft version with the draft option:
%\documentclass[draft]{uafthesis} % uncomment (and comment above) to include line numbers, and highlights where you're violating the poor margins
% This should go without saying, but uafthesis.cls should be in your path.

% set the paper size. This should not change for anyone, unless UAF starts using crazy European paper sizes.

%% The following packages are rather useful, and I recommend their inclusion. Some of them might be redundant, 
%% but it won't hurt to keep them. Feel free to add others as needed.
\usepackage{afterpage} % this enables you to put "Page" at the top of each page of your ToC, LoF, etc.
\usepackage{ppl} % a .sty file used by uafthesis.cls. Included in uafthesis1314.zip (from the Grad School site)
\usepackage{amsmath,graphicx,array} 
\usepackage{chapterbib} % this allows each chapter to have its own bibliography. You will 
\usepackage{natbib} % I prefer the natbib style
\usepackage{bibentry} % Enables you to put bibliography entries in the text. Useful if a chapter has been published
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % Some of us use funky, non-English letters.
\usepackage{rotating} % Useful if your tables or figures need to be sideways
\usepackage{longtable} % allows you to split tables across pages.

\begin{document}

%% I don't actually use this, but maybe someone else will. Basically just a Macro file
%\input{abbrevs}

%% Everything that goes on your title page. For example, your title. Change as appropriate.
\title{What I have done with the past several years of my life}
\author{Me}
\degreeyear{2013}
\degreemonth{August} % remember: this can ONLY be May, August, or December.
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
\prevdegrees{B.A.,B.S.,M.Sc.} 

%% The following is for your Signature Page.
\department{Geology and Geophysics} %this is your department.
\college{College of Natural Science and Mathematics} % The College in which your department is housed.
\numberofmembers{5} % The number of members of your committee (including the committee chair)

%% If you want to put the names of your committee members on the Signature page, you have to specify them.
%% Remember - be consistent and correct with spelling, titles, middle names/initials, etc.
\gsdean{Dr. John Eichelberger} % the grad school dean's name 
\colldean{Dr. Paul Layer} % the dean of the college's name 
\depchair{Dr. Sarah Fowell} % the department chair's name
\commchair{Dr. Andy Advisor} % the committee chair's name

%% Next up, the committee members. There should be n-1 of these (where n is the number of committee members you have).
%	Since I have 5 committee members, I have 4 names below. Order them as you see fit.
\comone{Dr. Committee Member 1}
\comtwo{Dr. Committee Member 2}
\comthree{Dr. Committee Member 3}
\comfour{Dr. Committee Member 4}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Now we're into the main parts of the thesis. I'll use generic input file names.

%% Uncomment below to add the beginning fly page (a blank sheet of paper at the beginning to "protect" during binding")
%\flypage

%% make the signature page and title page
%% I'm choosing a named signature page, but you can choose a normal signature page
%% by uncommenting the following line (and commenting the next)
%\makesig % a blank (unnamed) signature page
\makenamedsig % a named signature page
\maketitle % the title page. Obviously.

%% The following all assumes that you have different input .tex files (abstract.tex, etc) for each chapter of the thesis. 
%%	If you don't, you should.

%% make the abstract.
\begin{abstract}
	\input{abstract}
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents % make the table of contents
\listoffigures % make the list of figures
\listoftables % make the list of tables
%% the following are not things that I need, but you might.
%\listofothermaterials % make the list of other materials (movies, etc.)
%\listofappendices % make the list of appendices, as needed.

%% Be sure to thank your Mom, your Dad, your Dog, Cat, whatever (or whomever).
\begin{acknowledgements}
	\input{acknowledgements}
\end{acknowledgements}

%% here's where things get a little weird. In order to put "Page" at the top of every page of the ToC (LoF, etc.), we
%	have to spoof a ToC entry that just says "Page". This is how you do it. Put one before the Intro, so that it's
%	ready to go on Page 2 (Page 1 of each of the ToC, LoF, etc. is already taken care of).
\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\afterpage{~\hfill{Page}\par\medskip}}

% include statement for the introduction.
\include{introduction}

% include statement for Chapter 2 (really, the first actual chapter)
\include{chapter2}

%% adding these here so they're ready for page 3 of the ToC, and page 2 of the LoF. YMMV. Move as needed.
\addtocontents{lof}{\protect\afterpage{~\hfill{Page}\par\medskip}}
\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\afterpage{~\hfill{Page}\par\medskip}}

% include statement for Chapter 3
\include{chapter3}

% include statement for Chapter 4
\include{chapter4}

% include statement for the conclusion
\include{conclusion}

%% begin the appendix
%% note: the appendices have special commands now. They're basically the same, but now with 'app' in front of them.
%% in case that wasn't clear: \appchapter replaces \chapter, \appsection replaces \section, and so on to \appsubsubsection.
%% We don't descend any further into hell than \appsubsubsection.
\appendix % be sure to include this - it resets the chapter counter to zero, and changes the numbering to letters
\include{appendix}

%% include a fly page at end, for your dead homies (to guide your way home)
%\flypage

%% That's it. This should provide you with a properly formatted UAF Thesis (TM).
